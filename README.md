# Classic Arcade Game Clone: Frogger

This game is a [project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) from the [Front End Web Developer nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001/) by [Udacity](https://udacity.com).

## Objective
Catgirl is not like those cats that hate water, she wants to cross the stoned path so she can finally go for a swim at the lake. So all you need to do is
get Catgirl to the water and you **win** the game.   
But beware the bugs! They are Catgirl's mortal enemies and you can't touch them at all or you **lose**!  

So, to sum it up:
1. Get to the water
2. Don't touch the bugs
